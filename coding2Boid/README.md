## Boid Project

We implemented a boid project as a group of two(Anthony Garnett & Melis Meri√ß). 

* Boid.h and Boid.cpp are used as a base class and Child.h/Child.cpp are inherited from it to add size and color functions to create different colored and sized boids.
* Added ofxGUI addon to easily change the movements. We can modify the separation and cohesion weights and see the change of the interaction between boids. 
* We used ofEasyCam and lights to create a 3D scene and see the interactions from different angles.
